# Replication Research (R2) — Mirror Site

A beautiful, static, self-updating mirror of the journal
[*Replication Research*](https://ejournals.uni-muenster.de/index.php/replicationresearch/index)
(OJS), hosted on GitHub Pages.

- **No manual content entry.** A GitHub Action fetches everything from OJS
  daily — issues, articles, abstracts, static pages, announcements, PDFs, and
  usage statistics — and redeploys the site.
- **Submit manuscript** buttons lead to the OJS submission portal.
- **Download PDF** leads to the canonical PDF download URL on OJS (so OJS's
  own download counter still increments); each article page also embeds a
  [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) viewer (zoom, search, paging)
  that renders a mirrored, same-origin copy of the PDF for in-page reading.
- **Usage statistics** combine two sources, kept separate because they
  measure different things: OJS abstract-page views and PDF downloads come
  from the authenticated OJS REST API (`OJS_API_KEY`, same pattern as the
  [r2d2 dashboard](https://github.com/LukasRoeseler/r2d2)) and only count
  activity on ejournals.uni-muenster.de itself; views of the *mirror's own*
  pages come from [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com) (free, no
  cookies), tracked via the snippet in `templates/base.html` and read back
  through its API (`GOATCOUNTER_API_TOKEN`).
- **"Under Review"** on the home page lists submissions still active in
  review. The editors maintain this themselves in a Google Sheet (view-only
  link, read via its CSV export - no credentials needed); a row only shows
  up once its "Stage website" column is filled in, so nothing goes public
  before an editor chooses to. Titles/authors come from Crossref when a
  preprint DOI is given, else fall back to the sheet's own columns.

## How it works

```
scripts/fetch.py   scrapes OJS + calls its API  ->  data/*.json, assets/pdf, assets/img
scripts/build.py   Jinja2 templates             ->  _site/  (deployed to Pages)
scripts/serve.py   local dev server (simulates the GitHub Pages subpath)
```

`fetch.py` refuses to write (exits non-zero) if the harvest looks broken, so a
temporary OJS outage never wipes the published site. Harvested HTML stores the
site root as `__BASE__`; `build.py` substitutes the real base path, so moving
to a custom domain later only means changing `BASE_URL`.

## One-time setup

1. Create the GitHub repository (currently
   [`replicationresearch/replicationresearch.github.io`](https://github.com/replicationresearch/replicationresearch.github.io))
   and push this folder to `main`. The workflow derives `BASE_URL` from the
   repository name, root ("/") for a `<user-or-org>.github.io` repo name and
   `/<repo>/` otherwise, so a rename only needs updating the defaults in
   `scripts/build.py` and `scripts/serve.py` for local use if the new name
   crosses that boundary.
2. Add the OJS API key: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
   New repository secret**, name `OJS_API_KEY` (same token as in r2d2;
   from OJS: User Profile → API Key). Without it the site still builds,
   just without OJS views/downloads or the submission-funnel charts.
3. Optional, for mirror-page view counts: create a free site at
   [goatcounter.com](https://www.goatcounter.com) (site code
   `replicationresearch` is already wired into `templates/base.html` — change
   it there if you use a different code), then **Settings → API** in the
   GoatCounter dashboard to create a token with read access to stats, and add
   it as the `GOATCOUNTER_API_TOKEN` repository secret. Without it, mirror
   views are simply omitted (OJS views and downloads still show).
4. Enable Pages: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source:
   GitHub Actions**.
5. Run the workflow once: **Actions → "Fetch content and deploy mirror" →
   Run workflow**. After that it runs daily at 04:23 UTC.

## Local development

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/fetch.py    # optional: put OJS_API_KEY=... in a .env file first
python scripts/build.py
python scripts/serve.py    # -> http://localhost:8737/
```

## Custom domain later

`BASE_URL` is already root ("/") for this repo, so just add the domain under
**Settings → Pages → Custom domain** (GitHub then serves a CNAME) and point
the domain's DNS at GitHub Pages.

## Citable snapshot for Zenodo

**Actions → "Build Zenodo snapshot export" → Run workflow** builds the site,
then flattens every issue/article/announcement/page into one self-contained
`r2-mirror-snapshot-<date>.html` file (CSS and images inlined, no companion
folder) and attaches it to a new GitHub Release (tagged `zenodo-export-<date>`)
— run it whenever you want a new, dated, citable version. Download it from
the release and upload it to Zenodo yourself, or connect this repo to
[Zenodo's GitHub integration](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content)
once, and every release you create this way becomes a new Zenodo version
automatically.

Open the file directly (double-click, no server needed) to browse it before
uploading. Each section is labelled with its original path on the live site
(e.g. `/articles/9577`), and the table of contents at the top links to every
one via a same-document fragment — so a specific page inside an archived
snapshot can be cited or linked to directly, e.g.
`r2-mirror-snapshot-2026-07-10.html#articles/9577`.

`scripts/assemble_snapshot.py` does the flattening: it reads the multi-file
`_site/` build (root-relative links, one directory per page — the same
output `scripts/build.py` produces for the live GitHub Pages deploy) and
combines it into the single file, rewriting internal links to fragment
anchors and inlining local images/CSS as it goes.

## OJS upgrade (3.3 → 3.5): freeze and safe switch-over

**Update freeze (currently off).** Setting `FREEZE_FROM` in
`.github/workflows/build.yml` to a date freezes the daily updates from that day
on (it is empty at the moment, so the daily updates run normally; the planned
2026-11-09 upgrade was called off). While frozen, scheduled runs do nothing, so
the live site keeps showing the last good build. Pushes still deploy, but from
the data already in the repo (OJS is not contacted). To lift a freeze set the
repository **variable** `MIRROR_RESUME` to `true` (Settings → Secrets and
variables → Actions → Variables) or clear the date.

After the upgrade, check the new OJS before going live again:

1. **Actions → "Fetch content and deploy mirror" → Run workflow**, tick
   **dry_run**. It harvests the upgraded OJS and compares it with the data of
   the previous harvest (`scripts/harvest_guard.py`), but writes, commits and
   deploys nothing. The result is on the run's summary page: OJS version,
   dataset sizes, how many articles have each field filled, and every
   *blocking problem* (an article, page or field that existed before and is
   missing, empty or much shorter now). The run is red if anything blocks.
2. Fix the scraper if something is listed (the usual suspect is a renamed theme
   class in `scripts/fetch.py`), run the dry run again until it is clean.
3. Run the workflow once **without** dry_run but with **accept_ojs_upgrade**
   ticked. A changed OJS major.minor version is otherwise refused even when the
   checks pass, so an unnoticed upgrade can never go live by itself. (If
   something shrank on purpose, tick **accept_changes** as well.)
4. Set `MIRROR_RESUME=true` (or delete the freeze) to resume the daily updates.

The same checks run on every normal harvest, so a scrape that quietly returns
empty fields can never replace good data: the run fails, opens the "Mirror
build failed" issue, and the live site stays as it was. The harvest also still
needs the OJS REST API (`OJS_API_KEY`, view/download counts only — a failing
API call keeps the previous numbers).

GitHub switches off scheduled workflows after 60 days without repository
activity; a long freeze with no commits can therefore also disable the daily
schedule — re-enable it from the Actions tab (or push anything) when resuming.

## Notes

- GitHub disables scheduled workflows after ~60 days without repository
  activity. The daily statistics commit usually counts as activity; if the
  journal *and* its stats go quiet for two months, re-enable the workflow from
  the Actions tab.
- pdf.js is pinned (v6.1.200, `static/pdfjs/`, sourcemaps and unused locales
  removed). To upgrade, download a newer `pdfjs-*-legacy-dist.zip` from the
  [pdf.js releases](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/releases) and repeat the
  trim.
- **OJS upgrade resilience.** `fetch.py` scrapes OJS's default-theme HTML,
  whose class names (`.obj_article_details`, `.obj_issue_toc`, ...) have been
  stable across OJS 3.1–3.3 and are expected to keep working after an upgrade
  to 3.4/3.5. To be safe regardless, every scrape call is isolated with
  try/except: one broken selector degrades just that issue, article, or page
  (logged to the workflow run's output) instead of crashing the whole
  harvest, and a couple of the most load-bearing selectors (article title,
  article container) have a generic-HTML fallback. The site is only ever
  refused a publish if the *aggregate* result looks broken (no issues, no
  articles, missing PDFs) — see the sanity checks at the end of
  `fetch.py`'s `main()`. If OJS is upgraded and something still looks off,
  check the failed run's log for which selector stopped matching.
- **If a scheduled run fails**, the job stops before the commit/build/deploy
  steps, so the currently published site is left exactly as it was — nothing
  gets overwritten with broken or partial data. You'll also get a heads-up
  two ways: GitHub's own "workflow run failed" email (on by default for repo
  owners; check **your GitHub notification settings → Actions** if you don't
  want to rely on it), and a repository issue titled "Mirror build failed"
  that the workflow opens automatically (and closes again once a later run
  succeeds), in case the email gets missed or filtered.
